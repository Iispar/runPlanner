# Run planner
## About this project
This is the first project for the device-agnostic desing course. 

In running it is typical to create a plan for a race in which you determine how much and what type of runs you will be doing each week. The goal of these plans is avoid injury by not increasing the run load too much at a time and avoiding too much burdensome runnning. This also helps to to diversify your runs as you will choose different runs for each week. A typical run week could consist of one fast run, one long run, and two slow runs. In which a fast run is something like intervals, long run is a longer run with low effor, and slow runs are slow runs as the name implies.

This application allows the user to create plans which they can then follow. Each plan is created based on input from the user and the user can view statistics, information, and mark their progress.

## Deployment

This application is deployed [here](https://run-planner-psi.vercel.app/#/home)

## Usage

The application should be straight forward to use. When first opening the application there isn't alot of information available and you can start by creating a plan for yourself. This can be done from the home page or from the all plans page, which can be reached from the hamburger menu on the top right. The plan creating is a simple form where each field describes itself. Just fill all the required information and create a project. Then you can select a plan from the all plan page and view it in detail. Here you can delete the plan or star it as selected from the top right corner. Starring a project marks it as the ative project and its data will be available from the home page.
